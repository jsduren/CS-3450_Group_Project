        <h3>About</h3>
        MECH-Armies is a real time strategy game, with the object to destroy the enemy base.

        <h3>How to play</h3>

        Move the player jet moving the controls listed below.  Shoot enemy attackers with the player jet or the MECH.  Order different cargo units, and set up their functions via control menu.  Transport units with the jet.
        You need to strategize a way to take over intermediate bases to advance across the map, and destory the enemy base without running out of energy or having your home base destroyed by the enemy.

        <h5>Unit Programs</h5>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Stand Ground:  The unit will not move from this point and shoot at any opposing unit that comes close to it</li>
                <li>Guard: The unit will move to attack anything that comes near it</li>
                <li>Attack Main:  The unit will find the other players main base and move to attack it</li>
                <li>Attack Nearest Object:  The unit will move to find the nearest base and attack it</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h5>Take over a base</h5>
        <div>
            To take over a base a player must deploy 4 infantry that make it to the center of the base.  The main base of the opposing player cannot be take over, it may only be destroyed.
            The lights on the base will indicate how many of infantry units are in the base.
